Files
=====

This library contains:

- slides.js - for basic slider functionality
- default-slides-ui.js - for a basic interface definition
- default-slides-ui.css for the base style

Setup
=====

to create a new Slider we need some basic CSS to set the viewport width and height::

    #slides {
        height:480px;
        width: 640px;
    }

a little bit of HTML, the slide nodes must not be inside the #slides container::

    <div id="slides">
        <div class='slide'>
            <img src="http://lorempixel.com/640/480/people/1" />
        </div>
        <div class='slide'>
            <img src="http://lorempixel.com/640/480/people/2" />
        </div>
    </div>

and some JS::

    require(['lib/score/slides', 'default-slides-ui'], function(Slides, DefaultSlidesUI) {
        var slides = new Slides({
            'ui': DefaultSlidesUI,
            'ui-nodes': document.getElementsByClassName('slide'),
            'ui-node': document.getElementById('slides')
        });
        slides.on('transitionStart', function(state) {
            console.log('user interaction time to track a click', state);
        });
        slides.on('transitionComplete', function(state) {
            console.log('the transition is complete', state);
        });
    });

- all configurations prefixed with ui- and passed to Slides will be passed to the SlidesUI class.
